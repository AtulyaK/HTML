The Internet is a place where an individual can access information. However, the method of accessing the information is a bit more complicated than just clicking the left mouse 
key.

There are three components, on a high level, to accessing a webpage. There is the browser, the server, and the html files, pictures, sounds, and other files on the server. 
The browser sends a request to access the files to the server.The server checks if it has the file. If it does, it sends the file to the browser. 
  ex:
      An example here would be clicking a link on Google. Google sends a request to the server hosting the HTML page. The server sends the web pages to Google. Google then displays
      the HTMl page.
One question that arises is how does Google know what to display.

That is where HTML comes into play. HTML gives Google or any browser what to display: contetn and structure of a page.
